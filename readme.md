# My Financial Balance

Motivation
Past 2 years, a customized Excel format is used to keep record and conduct simple financial analysis per month of 
    
    * Incomes per month
    * Expense per categories
    * Savings per family members 
    * Paying loans per categories. 
    * Currently the process is tedious and time consuming.

Help myself make better spending decisions
There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to managing money. A good money manager doesn't simply mean automatically generating pretty charts. A good money manager adapts to a user's needs, gives them control and flexibility to customize it as needed, and delivers insightful, actionable advice to help plan for the future.
Personal financial services are designed to help you get a handle on your money. You can use them to get a information on:

    * How much I made?
    * How much I owe?
    * How I spend on what I have?
    * How much I save?
    * How to spend my money differently in the future?

Mainly to focus on figuring out a budget or planning a strategy to get out of debt.
